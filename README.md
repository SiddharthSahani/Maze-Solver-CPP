# Pathfinding Algorithms in C++

A mini project to clear my understanding of algortihms used in pathfinding.

---

## Dependencies
- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) easy to use graphics library

---

## Algorithms implemented / to be implemented
- [X] DepthFirstSearch (DFS)
- [X] BreadthFirstSearch (BFS)
- [ ] A-Star
- [ ] Dijkstra

---

### Editing the maze
- Hold `LMB` and move the mouse around the maze to toggle between path and wall
- Hold `RMB` to set both start and end points

---

### Running the algorithm
1. After setting up the maze, press `SPACE`
2. When the maze is being solved, the visited cells will be highlighted
3. When the maze is solved, the path will be highlighted
4. To switch between the algorithms, edit `main.cpp`
